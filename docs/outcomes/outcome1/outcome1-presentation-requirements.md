your customer via your product/service. 
1.2.1.8. Key metrics: What are you using to measure the degree to which EACH perceived value mentioned in “User experience” was received

Lecturer’s policies: 
1. If you believe doing something else beside/in replacement of the guidance I have given you for each Checkpoint is better, DO IT! Keep in mind that some explanation needs to be given for your choice so let me know of your reasoning. 
2. All work must be completed by team members: copying or replicating or hiring any other current/past team’s work or someone else to do your work will result in a score of ZERO & failure of EXE201 course. Any team member who does not contribute or does not contribute fully on their agreed assigned parts will receive a score of ZERO or a reduction to all outcome grades at the end of the semester. 
3. Late submission equates to a score of ZERO for the entirety of the submitted work. 4. AI uses & help are allowed; however, 
Be aware: 
● Do NOT trust anything it says. Facts from AI tools can be taken from various sources, some of which are Wiki (Wikipedia is the largest of them). These Wiki sources are editable by ANYONE, so check the authenticity of the source. 
● AI uses’ disclosure: Please include a disclosure statement (a short paragraph) at the end of the presentation and/or report explaining what you used the AI for and what prompts you used to get the results. Failure to include this statement will result in a failing grade for the assignment. 
● There are pass/fail critical-thinking questions during the presentation of the submitted materials. If the student cannot answer these questions sufficiently, the student will receive a failing grade for the assignment and have to resubmit & represent at a later time. 
[Recommendation] Pass/fail critical-thinking questions practice tool: ChatGPT-Chat with your document 
5. Presentation’s attendance: All team members are required to be present. Team members who do not attend the presentation receive 50% of the team’s score unless provided acceptable reasons for absence with proof (email to thanhntl2@fpt.edu.vn). 
6. Before asking me (your lecturer) to make an exception for you, ask yourself this question first: “Is it impossible to honor my commitment, I mean truly impossible?”. If the answer is YES, I am willing to hear your explanation. If the answer is NO, my answer is NO.
